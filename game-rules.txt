## **Game Name Idea:** *Limit Break* or *House Draw*

### **Components**
- 80 cards: 4 houses (Griffon, Raven, Hufflepuff, Slytherin).
- Each house has 2 copies of numbers 0–9.
- All cards are numerical; suits (houses) are unused except possibly for future expansion.

### **Setup**
1. Choose player count (2–4).
2. Set **limit** based on players (suggestion):  
   - 2 players → limit = 15  
   - 3 players → limit = 21  
   - 4 players → limit = 25
3. Deal each player **x** cards (suggestion):  
   - 2 players → x = 15 each  
   - 3 players → x = 12 each  
   - 4 players → x = 10 each  
   The rest form the **leftover deck**.
4. Each player **looks at their cards once**, memorizes them, then places them face down as their **personal deck**.
5. Each player shuffles their personal deck and draws the **top two cards** to form their **hand**. The rest stay face down beside them.

---

### **Round Play**
1. **Start of round**: Draw one random card from leftover deck, reveal it, and add its value to **current sum**. Place this card in a **round discard pile**.
2. **Turn order**: Play proceeds clockwise.
3. On your turn, play **one card from your hand** face up to the round discard pile, add its value to current sum, then check:

#### **Sum Check**
- **Sum < limit**: Next player plays.
- **Sum = limit**:  
  → All **other players** draw **2 cards each** from leftover deck **without looking** and add them to their **personal deck**.  
  → The player who exactly hit limit may **reshuffle their personal deck but will not draw 2 new cards, instead after shuffling will pick two from their set** (rest remain face down).  
  → **New round begins**.
- **Sum > limit**:  
  → The player who exceeded draws **cards equal to the value they just played** from leftover deck, adds them to personal deck.  
  → **New round begins**.

---

### **Starting a New Round**
1. Move **all cards in round discard pile** to the **bottom of the leftover deck**.
2. Reset **current sum = 0**.
3. Draw a new starting card from leftover deck (as above).
4. Players **do not draw new hands** unless specified above — they keep playing with cards in hand until they need to draw from personal deck.

---

### **Drawing Cards into Hand**
- When your **hand is empty**, draw 2 cards from the top of your personal deck into hand.
- If personal deck runs out, you cannot draw more — last cards in hand are your final plays.

---

### **Winning**
- The first player to **play all cards** from their personal deck **and hand** wins immediately.
- Alternatively, if multiple players finish, the one with fewer penalty cards wins? (But your rules simply state: “the player can exit when their cards finish” — so first to empty their cards wins.)

---

## **How does this sound now?**
**Pros:**
- Memory element is strong and tense.
- Push-your-luck with limit creates dramatic moments.
- Getting others to draw when you hit limit exactly is a good catch-up/screw-you mechanic.

**Possible Issues:**
1. **Early game** could be slow if players are too cautious.
2. **Card counting/memory** might be too hard with 10–15 cards — maybe reduce `x` slightly.
3. **Houses currently irrelevant** — could add a rule: “If your card’s house matches the starting card’s house, sum increases by +1 extra” or something.

**Balance notes:**
- Going over limit can mean drawing up to 9 cards — quite punishing, which fits the risky playstyle.
- Hitting limit exactly is rewarding (you reshuffle your personal deck, others get more cards).
