# House of Cards

### Components

- Total 100 cards divided into Numericals and Specials.

  - 80 Numerical cards: 4 houses (Griffon, Raven, Hufflepuff, Slytherin).
    - Each house has 2 copies of numbers 0–9.

  - 20 Special cards: 4 per house (Hallows, Shield, Echo, Mirror, Swap)
    - Hallows – Instantly hit the limit; others draw two, you reshuffle.
    - Shield – Cancels the effect of Echo or Mirror just played.
    - Echo – Next number card played counts double toward the sum.
    - Mirror – Add the same number as the last played number card.
    - Shift – Swap one hand card with the top card of your deck.

### Setup

1. Choose player count (2–4).
2. Set limit based on players (suggestion):  
   - 2 players → limit = 15  
   - 3 players → limit = 21  
   - 4 players → limit = 25
3. Deal each player x cards (suggestion):  
   - 2 players → x = 15 each  
   - 3 players → x = 12 each  
   - 4 players → x = 10 each  
   The rest form the leftover deck.
4. Each player looks at their cards once, memorizes them, then places them face down as their personal deck.
5. Each player shuffles their personal deck and draws the top two cards to form their hand. The rest stay face down beside them.

### Round Play

1. Start of round: Draw one random card from leftover deck, reveal it, and add its value to current sum. Place this card in a round discard pile.
2. Turn order: Play proceeds clockwise.
3. On your turn, play one card from your hand face up to the round discard pile, add its value to current sum, then check:

#### Sum Check

- Sum < limit: Next player plays.
- Sum = limit:  
  → All other players draw 2 cards each from leftover deck without looking and add them to their personal deck.  
  → The player who exactly hit limit may reshuffle their personal deck but will not draw 2 new cards, instead after shuffling will pick two from their set (rest remain face down).  
  → New round begins.
- Sum > limit:  
  → The player who exceeded draws cards equal to the value they just played from leftover deck, adds them to personal deck.  
  → New round begins.

### Starting a New Round

1. Move all cards in round discard pile to the bottom of the leftover deck.
2. Reset current sum = 0.
3. Draw a new starting card from leftover deck (as above).
4. Players do not draw new hands unless specified above — they keep playing with cards in hand until they need to draw from personal deck.

### Drawing Cards into Hand

- When your hand is empty, draw 2 cards from the top of your personal deck into hand.
- If personal deck runs out, you cannot draw more — last cards in hand are your final plays.

### Winning

- The first player to play all cards from their personal deck and hand wins immediately.
- Alternatively, if multiple players finish, the one with fewer penalty cards wins? (But your rules simply state: “the player can exit when their cards finish” — so first to empty their cards wins.)
